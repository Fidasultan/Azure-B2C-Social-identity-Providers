	Salam Gents
Can you please study and tell me how we can do the task below:
We have an Azure Web App (.NET/C#, Azure SQL) that currently authenticates users against a records in our DB.

We need to configure the app to authenticate against the following identity providers:

1. Google
2. Facebook
3. Apple
4. Microsoft

Login page needs to be modified to accommodate new identities as illustrated.
